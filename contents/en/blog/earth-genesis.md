  The world is changing within our lifetime. As we see the convergence of the Web, IoT and the Blockchain, weâ€™re witnessing the convergence of the digital and the physical. We need a new type of network for a new type of world.

### The world is changing within our lifetimes and the pace of change is continuously accelerating. Trends and behaviors which once took multiple generations to shift are now changing at breathtaking speed and ideas which once seemed like science-fiction are now becoming very much science-fact.

The Web and mobile have ushered in an era of real-time ubiquitous information. The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is making the very fabric of our world smart and streaming with Big Data. The Blockchain enables the emergence of a trustless and decentralized economy. We believe the convergence of the Web, IoT and Blockchain represent a catalyst and tipping point for an entirely new generation of application.

This convergence empowers humans in a way which is unique in history but also enables total information awareness and a turn-key police state in which even the most benevolent leader can have access to extremely deep data sets and behavior analytics on every citizen.

We are living in a new type of world and we need a new type of network. One which can handle global-scale traffic in real-time. A network which can push HUGE data. A network which is alive with emergent knowledge while at the same time which protects personal liberty and financial sovereignty. We need a network which grows and evolves with the latest and greatest industry standards and which can maintain being 2 steps ahead of the next paradigm shift even as the pace of change accelerates.

## Global scale

We're living during a unique time where the world is evolving beyond the idea of the nation-state and a global society is emerging. We see **EARTH** as a network for censorship-resistant, borderless payments and data/value transfer. Our goal is for 10 billion people to do 1,000 on-chain transactions daily. We believe this enables world-wide commerce, tokenization, smart-contracts, the IoT and breakthroughs which we haven't yet imagined.

Today **EARTH** supports 2,000 transactions per second with a 3 second block time. Transactions can be considered totally settled after 20 blocks or around 1 minute. **EARTH's** turing-complete smart contracts, tokenization and a distributed exchange (DEX) lay a solid foundation for decentralized finance (DeFi) and bringing banking and financial services to non or underbanked people around the globe which will have a massively positive impact on the lives of billions.

## Governance

**EARTH** not only seeks to uplift the lives of the underbanked by giving them access to state-of-the-art digital financial services but we also aim to give everyone an equal voice in the governance of the system. Using Delegated Proof-of-Stake and staking pools each Account can stake, or freeze, 1 **EARTH** to get 1 vote which lasts for 24 hours. Blocks are validated by a group of 100 super delegates. These delegates are voted in and must burn 10,000 **EARTH** to put their name on a ballot to become a Super Delegate. Every hour an election and network upgrade are held. Super Delegates can submit proposals which are voted on during each election.

## A living protocol

We believe there is an industry-wide over-emphasis on locking down and ossifying protocols. We're taking an opposite approach with **EARTH** and are describing it as a "living protocol" with the intention to leverage the latest-and-greatest in computer science, networking, mathematics, security and industry best practices to keep **EARTH** continuously evolving. We are at the beginning of a great Renaissance and we want **EARTH** to continue to grow and each hour there is a network upgrade, the parameters of which are defined and voted upon by Super Delegates.

## Wait, is this another blockchain? Really?

We believe that the blockchain industry is just beginning and hasn't yet had a massive impact on the world. in our opinion the teams which will ultimately take this tech mainstream are still very much in their genesis stages. We believe that convergence of the Web, IoT and Blockchain is just at its infancy and will accelerate radically within our lifetimes. Weâ€™re at the very beginning of a great inflection point and feel a sense of responsibility and honor to help usher in and be stewards of such amazing technology.
